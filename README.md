This project is a basic one, who's aim is to use the openai API.

it makes advantage of two of the original bot's features:

- **No-Command**: This is the default mode. The bot will respond to any message you send it through the GPT3 regular completion API.
- **Commands**: This mode is activated by sending the bot a message starting with the command character. The default command character is `/`. 
  - Currently supported commands:
    - **`/h`**: Show a help message that lists all the commands
    - **`/s <message>`**: Save the message to the database
    - **`/q <question>`**: Ask a question about the database and get a response from GPT3
    - **`/f <message>`**: Find related messages in the database
